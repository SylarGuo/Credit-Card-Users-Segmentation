# BA820-GroupProject
A repository for our project on clustering credit card users.

Our project focused on finding specific clusters within credit card users, and we used the PCA,UMAP and KMeans tools to do so.
The clustering can be found in the first file, whilst the exploratory data analysis we put together can be found in the files with EDA in the name.

Other files in this repo worked as test runs to better understand the data.
